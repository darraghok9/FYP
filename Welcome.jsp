<title>Pairwise Preferences in Recommender Systems</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>
<h3>Welcome</h3>
<p>This project aims to explore the use of <i>preference relations</i> in recommender systems
	 instead of the conventional numeric ratings for products. A preference relation 
	 captures the relative preference of users between two products, e.g. "I prefer 
	 product X to product Y".<br><br>
	You will be asked to enter ratings on a scale from 0.5 to 5 for ten movies, and to 
	express a preference between a pair of movies for ten pairs of movies. Once you 
	have done this, you will be shown a page containing two sets of recommendations,
	 one based on each set of responses (ratings and preferences). At the end of this 
	 page is a link to a survey about the process, please fill this in.<br><br>
	Please note: your responses will be assigned a random ID number so that none of your
 	personal data (IP address, cookies etc.) will be saved.<br><br>
	If you wish to proceed, please click continue.<br><br>
